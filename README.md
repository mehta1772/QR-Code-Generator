## Overview.

This project is a QR code generator built using Node.js. It takes a URL input and generates a QR code image that can be easily scanned to access the provided URL. QR codes are useful for various applications, such as sharing website links, Wi-Fi credentials, and more.

## Features

- Generate QR codes from URLs.
- Customize QR code size and error correction level.
- Save generated QR codes as image files.
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehta1772/qr-code-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd qr-code-generator
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To generate a QR code, run the following command:

```bash
node generate.js --url <URL>
```

Replace `<URL>` with the URL you want to encode into the QR code.

### Options

- `--size <size>`: Set the size of the QR code (default: 300 pixels).
- `--error-correction <level>`: Set the error correction level (L, M, Q, H, default: M).
- `--output <filename>`: Specify the output file name (default: qr-code.png).

Example usage:

```bash
node generate.js --url https://generate.com --size 400 --error-correction H --output my-qr-code.png
```

This will generate a QR code for `https://example.com` with a size of 400 pixels, high error correction, and save it as `my-qr-code.png`.
